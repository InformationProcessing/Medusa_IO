## Medusa_IO

**Overview**
Basically there is a lot of files pushed but many were mainly for testing. The file named **something like integrated_file.py** I think that's the name is used to insert new data into the database as well as updating existing records. It also is shown how I'd like for you to send data across. There are files to initiate table and load data so you can create your own database as well as a starter json file containing user entries based on what I thought would be your college/github usernames which intially were numbered (sorry Michal if you look in the Json file you will see why I apologize). Game specific databases can be designed later on but I think this is now an ok template.
