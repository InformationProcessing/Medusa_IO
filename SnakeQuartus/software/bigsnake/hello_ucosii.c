* Description:                                                           *
* The following is a simple hello world program running MicroC/OS-II.The * 
* purpose of the design is to be a very simple application that just     *
* demonstrates MicroC/OS-II running on NIOS II.The design doesn't account*
* for issues such as checking system call return codes. etc.             *
*                                                                        *
